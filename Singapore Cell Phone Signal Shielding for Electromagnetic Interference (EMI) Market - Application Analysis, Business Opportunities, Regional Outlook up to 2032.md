Overview Of Cell Phone Signal Shielding for Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Market

Cell Phone Signal Shielding for Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) is used to isolate equipment so that it will not create electromagnetic field interference or be influenced by an external electromagnetic field. Many electronic products emit electromagnetic interference (EMI) which is a stimulant to the human body. Cell phones can be particularly bad, due to their proximity to the human body. The shielding can reduce the coupling of radio waves, electromagnetic fields and electrostatic fields. A conductive enclosure used to block electrostatic fields is also known as a Faraday cage. The amount of reduction depends very much upon the material used, its thickness, the size of the shielded volume and the frequency of the fields of interest and the size, shape and orientation of apertures in a shield to an incident electromagnetic field. EMF shields or RFI/RF shields and may be made from conductive rubber, like nitrile or silicone, or metals with high magnetic permeability. Metals such as nickel, copper, steel aluminum and other material are commonly used, the thickness of cell phone shielding about 0.2mm.
